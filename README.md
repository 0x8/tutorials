## About

The field of computer security is an unweildy beast containing massive amounts of
information. Finding good or succinct tutorials, especially in plain English, can be
a daunting task. My goal with this repository is to organize and develop for a number
of different topics and concepts across various facets of computer security. 

This is a project I am doing in my free time and as I learn some of the concepts myself.
The tutorials contained within draw upon many resources I have used over the years and
this is reflected where possible so that you may use these resources as well.

I hope to keep this repository fairly organized so it might be restructured 
quite often. The Master branch is intended only for tutorials I consider to be
in a "releasable" state. During the development of guides, they will exist as
their own branches. Please be aware that using any branch other than Master
means you are likely to be reading incomplete and possibly incorrect 
information.

I work and reside in the United States where it is perfectly legal to use most 
tools, however it may not be the case in your own country. If you are a 
resident of any other country, before you start messing with things ensure that
you are not violating any of your local laws.

I am not responsible for how you use this information however I think a good
philosophy is to only mess with things you have explicitly been granted
permission to mess with. Additonally, if you decide to mess with your own
programs and systems, you do so at your own risk. I offer no assistance for
broken systems.
