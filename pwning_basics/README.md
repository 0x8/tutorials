# Pwning Basics

#### A collection of Pwning related tutorials

---

## Overview

Pwning (or binary exploitation) is the act of taking advantage of some flaw in software
in order to change the way it behaves. There can be a large number of steps involved
along the way and there is no set method to always exploit a program or system but
a few key concepts are fundamental to getting anywhere in your efforts.

Contained within this directory are several subdirectories containing tutorials on these
fundamental skills that are required for pwning.

## Additional Resources

Security is hard, thats why it pays. One method of explanation may not work for everyone,
and some people will want more than what I can offer in these tutorials. For those reasons
I am including links to a number of resources that I hope will aid the curious in their
quest to understanding pwning more.

[MicroCorruption](https://microcorruption.com)

MicroCorruption is a great game developed to provide an interactive introduction into reading and
understanding assembly language. While it is a very scaled down example, the concepts hold in most
languages and it can really help introduce you to debugging programs to break them.

[LiveOverflow's Binary Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN) 

LiveOverflow has put together a great series on binary exploitation techniques that succinctly 
showcases many of the topics covered here.

Murmus has weekly streams on Security topics and the processes involved in exploiting software,
systems, and devices. They are definitely worth a watch for those interested in the topics.
